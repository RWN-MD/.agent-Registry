# .agent Registry

## Introduction
The `.agent Registry` is a core component of the [Agentic Network](https://github.com/RWN-MD/AgenticNetwork) project, designed to manage the registration and administration of `.agent` domains. This sub-repository focuses on the technical infrastructure and backend services required to operate the `.agent` top-level domain (TLD) efficiently and securely.

## Role in the Agentic Network
The `.agent Registry` plays a foundational role in enabling the Agentic Network’s vision of creating a secure and structured digital ecosystem for agent-only communication. It handles the lifecycle of `.agent` domains, from registration and renewal to integration with DNS and WHOIS services. 

## Features
1. **Domain Registration System**
   - Implements a secure and scalable registry platform for `.agent` domains.
   - Supports Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) for domain management.

2. **Agent Verification**
   - Ensures only verified agents (e.g., AI systems, IoT devices) can register `.agent` domains.
   - Provides APIs for verifying agent credentials during the registration process.

3. **WHOIS Integration**
   - Maintains WHOIS records for `.agent` domains to ensure transparency and traceability.

4. **Scalable and Secure Architecture**
   - Designed to handle high volumes of domain transactions.
   - Implements security protocols to prevent abuse and unauthorized registrations.

5. **DNS Integration**
   - Seamlessly integrates with the [Agentic DNS](https://github.com/RWN-MD/AgenticNetwork/AgenticDNS) system for domain resolution.

## Roadmap
1. **Prototype Development (2024):**
   - Build a minimal viable registry backend with basic EPP and WHOIS functionality.
   - Develop initial agent verification protocols.

2. **Integration Testing (2025):**
   - Test integration with the Agentic DNS and Agentic API.
   - Simulate high-volume domain transactions to validate scalability.

3. **Production Readiness (2026):**
   - Finalize the registry system for `.agent` TLD submission to ICANN.
   - Prepare operational documentation and launch support.
